## Introduction

## Technology stack
vue2.5x + vue-class-component + vuex + vuex-class + vue-router + webpack2.6 + ES6/7 + sass + element-ui

**Note: This project uses vue-class、 vue-class-component、 element-ui@2.0.0+ version, so the minimum compatible vue@2.5.0**

## Preparation

 **This project is not a scaffolding and is more of an integrated solution.**

 **This project does not support low version browsers (e.g. IE). Please add polyfill yourself if you need them.**

vi hosts file
add _your_ip_address_ wx.j-make.cn
